 I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Texas State University, with a research focus on quality assessment of images and video. My work explores how machine learning, computer vision, and immersive technologies can be combined to improve the way we evaluate and experience visual media.

My work has been published in top venues such as IEEE ICIP and QoMEX, and I was honored with the Best Paper Award at WebMedia â€˜22.
