Light fields is a 4D image that represents the spatial and angular distribution of a ligth in a defined space. 
These imagens are generated using a plenotic Camera. This type of camera has a mayn lens and a micro lenses to generate the image. 
The most diferrence between the plenoptic camera to the conventional camera is the micro lens camera as explained by Dr Brian Thurow in 
[Plenoptic Cameras: The Future of Imaging - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyRgcD4VxE8). Theses carachteristc allow the sensor plane to 
capture diferent pixels from diferrent angular and spatial distribution of the light. As showing in the following image, Dr Thurow explained that the micro lens capture different path on the light and this structure allow to has a new focal plane. Thus the image can be refocused.

The light fields image is composed by the diferrent perspective views that are generated by the micro lens, called sub-aperture image (SAI). Christopher Hahne explained with the following image that the sub-aperture image consist in pixels from the same relative micro image position u (highlighted by colour).

Christopher Hahne explained that: "For instance, the central position u1, highlighted in yellow colour, corresponds to the central view whereas surrounding micro image positions u, e.g. blue or green, represent adjacent views from different perspective". The representation of a subaperture is showing in the following:
